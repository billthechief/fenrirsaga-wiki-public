We are thrilled to announce the official launch of the Fenrir Saga Wiki! This project has been a labor of love, designed to be the definitive, central source of information for our entire community.

Our goal is for this wiki to be your one-stop resource for everything you need to know about the server. Whether you're a new player just starting your adventure or a seasoned veteran planning your next move, you'll find it all here.

### What You'll Find Inside

The wiki is already populated with essential information, including:

* **📈 Server Information:** Core [rates, stats, and custom mechanics](./../../features/server-information.md).
* **📜 Game Rules:** All you need to know to get started regarding the [server rules](./../../rules.md).
* **✨ Unique Features:** Detailed explanations of what makes our server special, from [gameplay enhancements](./../../features/techimprovements.md) to [custom NPCs](./../../features/qol-npcs.md).
* **📖 Custom Commands:** A comprehensive list of all [available player commands](./../../features/qol-commands.md).
* **❓ FAQ:** Answers to the most [Frequently Asked Questions](./../../faq.md) we see from the community.

### We Need Your Help!

A wiki thrives on the collective knowledge and passion of its community. While we've laid the foundation, we know the best and most detailed information comes from you, the players.

We are officially looking for **Community Contributors** to help us expand and refine this knowledge base!

Are you an expert on all things Poring? A walking encyclopedia of monster drops and strategies? We want you! Contributions can be anything from:

* ✒️ Writing in-depth server mechanics (mostly custom)
* ✍️ Correcting a typo or clarifying an existing article

If you are interested in becoming a wiki contributor, please reach out to **Pondwater, Guppy or Chief** on our official Discord server. Let's work together to build the ultimate resource for Fenrir Saga!

Thank you for being part of our amazing community.
