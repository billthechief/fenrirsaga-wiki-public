# 📜 Server Rules

Welcome to Fenrir Saga! We're glad you're here. To ensure a fun, fair, and respectful environment for everyone, please follow the rules below. These apply both in-game and on our Discord server. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse for breaking them. Staff reserves the right to mute or remove players from the community if their behavior requires an excessive amount of time or effort to manage.

---

## 1. Community & Conduct

### 💬 Language
- English is the official language for all communication in public channels.
- If you're struggling with English, feel free to ask—someone will help you out!

!!! tip "Language Channels"
    There are language-specific in-game channels. Please use the `@channels` command to view the list.

### ❤️ Respect & Conduct
- Treat others with respect, even during disagreements.
- You're free to express opinions—but do so respectfully.
- Avoid needlessly controversial topics (e.g., politics, religion).

!!! quote "On Disagreeing with Others"
    We value diverse perspectives, but raging at others is not welcome. Respect differences in opinion, and don't try to “win” arguments. Our staff reads through discussions and filters useful feedback. Differing opinions help the server grow, but hostility does not.

### 🚫 Harassment
Harassment will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Repeatedly bothering someone after they have asked you to stop.
- Making threats or engaging in intimidation.
- Hate speech or targeting someone based on their identity.

* **Penalty:** Minimum 3-day ban. Severe cases will result in a **permanent ban**.

### 📢 Spam
Avoid the following:

- Repetitive messages or flooding channels with links.
- Spamming gifs, memes, or skills in crowded areas.
- Keep communication relevant and respectful.

* **Penalty:** Mutes, temporary, or permanent bans, subject to GM discretion.

## 2. Gameplay Rules

### 🐞 Exploits and Bug Abuse
- Do not exploit bugs or abuse unintended game mechanics.
- If you find a potential exploit, you must report it in the `#bug-reports` channel or directly to a staff member, especially if it is sensitive in nature.

* **Penalty:** Deliberate abuse may result in temporary or permanent bans, subject to GM discretion.

### 💔 Griefing & Mobbing

#### Mobbing Etiquette
- Mob trains are acceptable **only if** your party is alone on the map.
- If other players are present, be considerate. Communication solves most issues.
- While no one "owns" a map, intentionally disrupting another party's gameplay is considered griefing.

!!! note "Rule of Thumb"
    If someone is already on a map, reach out to them and find a way to share the space before you begin mobbing.

#### Kill & Loot Stealing
- Accidental Kill-Stealing (KS) happens. Please use the `@noks` command to prevent it.
- Repeated, intentional kill-stealing after a warning is considered griefing.
- Loot stealing is only permitted if the original killer gives you explicit permission.

* **Penalty:** Repeated offenses are considered griefing and are subject to bans.

### 🏆 MVP Rules
MVPs are considered Free-for-All (FFA) with the following guidelines:

* The FFA rules only apply when the MVP is active and up for competition.
* These rules apply solely to players who are actively competing for the MVP.
* **Mob dropping** (using monsters that are not the MVP or its minions) or **dead branching** to interfere with another player's competition is strictly forbidden and considered griefing.

!!! question "What does 'Actively Competing' mean?"
    **You ARE actively competing if:**

    * Your full party, or a majority of it, is on the map and fighting the MVP.
    * Your party has engaged the MVP but died and is now returning to the fight.

    **You are NOT actively competing if:**

    * You cannot feasibly kill the MVP with your current party.
    * You have only scouted the MVP and your party is en-route (arriving in more than a minute).

!!! tip "Why This Matters"
    It can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate competition and griefing. To avoid frustration and potential penalties, arrive with your party **before** engaging an MVP and do not interrupt an ongoing fight unless you are clearly present and participating. Violations will be considered griefing.

### 😴 Leeching
- Leeching is allowed but generally discouraged.
- There is a **3-minute AFK timer** that disables EXP gain, making passive leeching ineffective.

## 3. Account, Client, & Trading Rules

### 🖥️ Multi-Clienting
- Only one account per human can be online at a time.
- The game client has multi-clienting disabled by default.

!!! danger "One Human, One Client"
    Attempting to bypass this restriction is a **permanent ban** offense. Using a second computer, a virtual machine, or any other workaround is a direct violation of this rule.

### 🌐 IP Whitelisting
- By default, the server will disconnect sessions if it detects more than one concurrent connection from a single IP address.
- If you have multiple people playing from the same household, please open a support ticket on Discord to have your IP address whitelisted by the staff.

### 🤝 Account Sharing
- You are free to create as many master and player accounts as you wish.
- Account sharing is permitted, but you do so **entirely at your own risk.**

!!! warning "Do So At Your Own Risk"
    Staff may not be able to assist you with lost items, characters, or other issues resulting from account sharing.

### 💰 Real Money Trading (RMT)
- Advertising or participating in the buying, selling, or trading of in-game zeny, items, or accounts for real-world money, gift cards, or any outside services is strictly prohibited.

* **Penalty:** Permanent ban.

### 🛠️ Bots, Macros, & Client Modifications
The following are strictly forbidden:

- Bots
- Macros / AutoHotkey (AHK)
- GRF edits or any unapproved client modifications (ask staff first).
- Any other automation tools.

!!! success "The Only Exception"
    You may use software to map a *singular* key to another *singular* key for accessibility purposes (e.g., mapping a side mouse button to a keyboard key). Complex, multi-action macros are forbidden.

* **Penalty:** Permanent ban.
