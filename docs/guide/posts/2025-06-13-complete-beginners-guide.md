## I. Introduction: Your Adventure Begins!

The term "pre-renewal" signifies Ragnarok Online as it existed before several major updates that significantly altered gameplay. This version offers a nostalgic experience characterized by distinct mechanics for stats, experience gain, and class abilities. Players accustomed to modern MMORPGs or Renewal RO will find a different pace and a greater emphasis on strategic character development and party play.

!!! info "Fenrir Saga Era"
    Fenrir Saga is an **Episode 13.2** server. This means the world includes content such as the Ash Vacuum, Splendide, Manuk, and the Nidhoggur's Nest instance. 
    
    Key server mechanics include a maximum Attack Speed (ASPD) of **190** and rates of **1.5x Base/1.5x Job EXP**. For a full breakdown, check out our [**Server Information**](./../../features/server-information.md) page.

While these advanced areas represent exciting future goals, this guide will focus on the foundational knowledge every new adventurer needs to take their first confident steps.

## II. Taking Your First Steps: Core Concepts

Understanding the fundamentals of character creation and core game mechanics is essential. These initial choices will shape your entire adventure.

### Creating Your First Character
Every player's journey begins humbly as a **Novice**. The character creation process is straightforward. As a Novice, you'll learn the very basics of interaction and combat, preparing you for your future class.

### Understanding Levels: Base vs. Job
Your character progresses through two distinct types of levels:

* **Base Level:** Represents your character's overall growth. Gaining Base Levels awards **Status Points** to increase your core stats.
* **Job Level:** Reflects your mastery of your current class. Each Job Level gained grants one **Skill Point** to learn new skills. When you change jobs (e.g., from Novice to Swordsman), your Job Level resets to 1.

!!! warning "Maximum Your Job Level!"
    
    * **Novice:** Job Level **10**.
    * **First Class (e.g., Acolyte):** Job Level **50** (you can change to a second class from Job Level **40**).
    * **Second Class (e.g., Priest):** Job Level **50**.
    
    Changing jobs early (e.g., at job level **40**) means you will **permanently lose out on valuable skill points**, which can significantly impact your character's power and versatility later on.

### The Building Blocks: Your Six Core Stats
Status points are invested into six core stats. Understanding their effects is key to building an effective character.

!!! tip "Don't Fear Mistakes!"
    While planning your stats is important, don't worry about making a permanent mistake! Fenrir Saga has a **[Skill & Stat Reset NPC](./../../features/qol-npcs.md)** that can help you re-spec your character (for a Zeny fee).

| Stat | Primary Effects | Key Secondary Effects |
|---|---|---|
| **`STR`** | Increases melee ATK & Weight Limit. | Bonus ATK at thresholds; +1 ranged ATK per 5 STR. |
| **`AGI`** | Increases Attack Speed (ASPD) & Flee (dodge rate). | Improves movement speed for some classes. |
| **`VIT`** | Increases Max HP, DEF, & HP recovery from items. | Adds resistance and reduces duration of Stun/Poison. |
| **`INT`** | Increases Max SP, MATK, MDEF, & SP recovery from items. | Adds resistance to Blind/Silence; boosts Heal power. |
| **`DEX`** | Increases ranged ATK, HIT, & reduces cast time. | Improves Steal/Forge/Brew success; slight ASPD boost. |
| **`LUK`** | Increases Critical Rate (CRIT) & Perfect Dodge. | Adds minor resistance to many statuses; boosts auto-cast chance. |

### The Currency of the Land: Zeny
`Zeny` is the lifeblood of the economy. You'll earn it by selling loot from monsters to NPCs. As you progress, you can become a merchant and vend to other players, a practice made easy on Fenrir Saga with the `@autotrade` command.

## III. Navigating the World: UI & Controls

Familiarizing yourself with the classic user interface and controls is crucial for a smooth experience.

## VI. Choosing Your Path: An Introduction to First Classes

At Job Level 10, after allocating all 9 available skill points into the "Basic Skill" tree, you are ready to choose your specialized path. The choice of a first class significantly influences your early game experience, affecting combat style, ease of soloing, and party dependence.

### The Main Six First Classes

#### 🛡️ Swordsman
* **Playstyle:** The quintessential melee warrior. Durable frontline fighters who can wield a variety of swords and spears. They can be built to withstand heavy damage (VIT-focused) or to deal consistent damage (STR/AGI-focused).
* **Key Strengths:** Relatively straightforward to play, high survivability due to good HP and defense, making them forgiving for new players.
* **Primary Stats:** `STR`, `VIT`, `AGI`.

#### 🔮 Mage
* **Playstyle:** Masters of elemental magic who cast powerful spells from a safe distance. They excel at exploiting enemy elemental weaknesses and have formidable Area of Effect (AoE) spells.
* **Key Strengths:** High damage potential and ability to clear groups of weaker monsters. Spells generally do not miss.
* **Primary Stats:** `INT`, `DEX`.

#### 🏹 Archer
* **Playstyle:** Ranged combat specialists using bows and arrows to strike from afar. They are adept at "kiting" – maintaining distance while continuously attacking.
* **Key Strengths:** Safe combat style due to range, effective solo leveling, and the advantage of elemental damage via different arrow types.
* **Primary Stats:** `DEX`, `AGI`, (and `LUK` for falcon builds).

#### 💰 Merchant
* **Playstyle:** The economic backbone of Rune-Midgard. They possess skills for Zeny acquisition, item appraisal, and setting up player shops (`@autotrade`). In combat, they use axes/maces and powerful cart-based skills.
* **Key Strengths:** Unique economic advantages, making Zeny more easily, and a surprisingly sturdy melee combat style.
* **Primary Stats:** `STR`, `DEX`.

#### ✨ Acolyte
* **Playstyle:** The primary support class, dedicated to healing (`Heal`) and buffing allies (`Blessing`, `Increase AGI`). They are crucial for tackling difficult content and can effectively combat Undead monsters by using Heal offensively.
* **Key Strengths:** Always in high demand for parties, making it easy to find groups, and a vital, relatively safe role in team play.
* **Primary Stats:** `INT`, `VIT`.

#### 🔪 Thief
* **Playstyle:** Agile and evasive combatants who rely on speed and cunning. They excel at dealing quick bursts of damage with daggers and have high Flee rates. Their skills revolve around stealth, poison, and quick strikes.
* **Key Strengths:** Fast-paced combat, high evasion making them difficult to hit, and satisfying single-target damage.
* **Primary Stats:** `AGI`, `STR`, `DEX`.

!!! tip "Don't get too attached to the script!"
    Ragnarok Online at its core is a Sandbox MMORPG, meaning that you are more than free to experiment with different classes and builds. All that matters is that you have fun in the process!

### A Note on Expanded Classes
Episode 13.2 also includes the **Taekwon Kid**, **Gunslinger**, and **Ninja**. These classes offer very distinct themes and mechanics but can present a steeper learning curve due to unique resource systems and specialized gear. It is generally advisable for new adventurers to first familiarize themselves with the game through one of the main six classes.

## VII. Early Adventure Tips & Tricks

A few key tips can make your initial experience much smoother and more enjoyable.

### Starting Out Strong: The Novice Training Grounds
The Novice Training Grounds is an invaluable starting point. It is **highly recommended** to talk to the NPCs and follow the tutorial here. They serve as an in-game tutorial and provide essential free resources like Novice Potions, fly wings, and basic equipment.

### Early Leveling
After leaving the Training grounds and changing classi, the fields around Prontera (Rockers, Fabres) or Payon (Spores, Willows) are excellent choices to gather some levels.

!!! tip "Party Up for Bonus EXP!"
    Don't be afraid to party with other players! On Fenrir Saga, the **party "tap" bonus is significantly increased**, making group play highly efficient and rewarding right from the start.

### Loot Everything!
It is crucial to pick up all items dropped by monsters. Even "etc" loot like `Jellopies` or `Fluff` can be sold to NPC vendors. This is vital for accumulating the initial Zeny needed for potions and supplies.

!!! tip "Create a Merchant to maximize profits!"
    Merchants have excellent zeny making skills like Overcharge and Discount! Fenrir Saga allows you to have a Merchant in a separate game account autotrading (vending) while you focus on leveling and questing on another game account. Check out our **[Player Commands Section](./../../features/qol-commands.md)** to learn about `@autotrade`.

### Essential Consumables & Item ID
* **Potions:** Always carry HP recovery potions (e.g, `Red Potions`) and SP recovery potions (e.g, `Blue Potions`).
* **Wings:** Always have a stack of `Fly Wings` (random teleport on the same map) and `Butterfly Wings` (teleport to your save point). They are lifesavers.
* **Item Identification:** Items with greyed-out names are unidentified. Buy `Magnifiers` from a Tool Dealer NPC to reveal their stats and make them equippable.
